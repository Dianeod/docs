_Fill Height_

: When checked, autosizes components to fill the height of the Layout panel. 

    !!! tip
        Best selected after adding all required components


_Advanced Layout_

: When checked, added components will best-fit the Layout panel by width. 

Layout panels are best used with the [Tab Control](#tabcontrol) and [Accordion](#accordion) components.  With the addition of a Layout panel to these components, multiple components can be dropped inside a Tab or Accordion section. 

1. Add an Accordion or Tab Control component

2. Left-click-and-drag the Layout panel inside the tab or accordion space

!!! tip "Check both"
    Unless you have a reason to lock the size of components dropped into a Layout panel, check both _Fill Height_ and _Advanced Layout_. This ensures the components in your Layout panel autosize along with the Accordion or Tab Control section that contains it.
