# Practical use-case examples  

The examples that follow consist of common practical tasks that a Java
developer might be expected to carry out when interfacing with kdb+. The
inline examples take the form of extracted sections of key logic
and output, and are available as example classes from
the [KxSystems/javakdb](https://github.com/KxSystems/javakdb/tree/master/src/kx/examples) repository for use as starting points or templates.

These examples assume, at minimum, a standard installation of 32-bit
kdb+ on the local system, and a suitable Java development environment.
