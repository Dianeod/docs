[A brief introduction](/tutorials/first-steps) is a very quick overview of downloading q and running your first query.

[In-memory queries](/tutorials/in-memory-queries) has you build a more complex dataset in memory and perform some queries and joins on it. The dataset is from an imaginary desktop PC monitoring and helpdesk support system.

[On-disk queries](/tutorials/on-disk-queries) has you download a set of scripts to build and run queries against a large on-disk database. The dataset is from an imaginary smart-meter network. It includes a basic HTML5 Business Intelligence tool which queries the database directly.
