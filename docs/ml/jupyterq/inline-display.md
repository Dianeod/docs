# Python and inline display


!!! warning "Experimental" 

Along with k and q code, python code can be run in a q process using embedPy. 
Charts created using matplotlib will be displayed inline in the notebook. 

![matplotlib](img/matplotlib.gif "Matplotlib inline display")

Cells with `/%python` anywhere in the cell at the start of a line will be evaluated as Python code.
This is intended only to make it easier to copy and paste Python snippets into kdb+ notebooks.
The language for syntax highlighting and code completion and help is still q.
