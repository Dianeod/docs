**Machine-learning** capabilities are at the heart of future technology development at Kx. Libraries are added here as they are released. Libraries are released under the Apache 2 license, and are free for all use cases, including 64-bit and commercial use.

Information can be found here on how to set up kdb+ to create a machine-learning environment using either Anaconda, Docker or a manual build.

<i class="fa fa-share-alt"></i> [Natural Language Processing](nlp) is the first module in our machine-learning suite, and manages the common functions associated with processing unstructured text. Functions for searching, clustering, keyword extraction and sentiment are included. A demonstration notebook of these features can be found [==here==](FIXME).

<i class="fa fa-share-alt"></i> [EmbedPy](embedpy) loads Python into kdb+, allowing access to a rich ecosystem of libraries such as scikit-learn, tensorflow and pytorch. Example notebooks of usage can be found [==here==](FIXME).

-   Python variables and objects become q variables â€“ and either language can act upon them. 
-   Python code and files can be embedded within q code.
-   Python functions can be called as q functions.


<i class="fa fa-share-alt"></i> [JupyterQ](jupyterq/) supports Jupyter notebooks for q, providing

-   Syntax highlighting, code completion and help
-   Multiline input (script-like execution)
-   Inline display of charts


All machine-learning libraries are:

-   well **documented**, with understandable and useful examples
-   maintained and **supported** by Kx on a best-efforts basis, at no cost to customers
-   released under the **Apache 2 license**
-   **free** for all use cases, including 64-bit and commercial use
