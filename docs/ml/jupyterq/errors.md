# Errors


Errors are displayed in red and fall into two classes.


## Parse errors

Parsing of the cell content is checked by the kernel before sending to the server for evaluation. The usual q parsing rules apply. Note that for foreign languages (lines preceded by `p)` for example) parsing is not checked.


## Evaluation errors

Runtime errors are reported from the server. One important thing to note is that as with q scripts, lines up to where the error occurred will have been executed.
```q
a:1
b:a+`
a:2
```
will result in `a` having a value of 1.
