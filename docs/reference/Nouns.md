Nouns can be classified in two ways:

-   by *structure*, e.g. atom, list, dictionary

<!-- -->

-   by *datatype*, e.g. integer, character, date, list

Note that *list* is both a structure (a list of things), and a datatype. Each item of a list will have its own datatype.

Data Structures
---------------

Q data structures are: atoms, lists, associations, dictionaries, tables and keyed tables.

The core building blocks are atoms and lists:

-   an *atom* is a single data item, such as a single integer, date or symbol
-   a *list* is an ordered collection of atoms or lists

Two lists can be joined in an association of keys and values. All other structures are built from lists and associations:

-   an *association* relates *keys* to *values*
-   a *dictionary* is an association where the keys are symbols
-   a *table* is a flipped (transposed) dictionary, where values all have the same length
-   a *keyed table* is an association of two tables (the key columns, and the non-key columns)
