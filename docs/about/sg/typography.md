# Typography


## Case

Use title case for proper names, e.g. _Python_, _C#_, _WebSocket_, _GitHub_. 
Among the notable exceptions are _macOS_, _q_ and _kdb+_.

The language is _q_. 
The database, process and product are all known as _kdb+_. 
Although both are proper names they are both set in lower case, except where they begin sentences or headings. 


## Headings

Set headings in sentence case, i.e., in lower case except for

-   the first letter
-   acronyms, e.g. _IPC_, _HTTP_, _API_
-   proper names, e.g. _Python_, _C#_, _WebSocket_, _GitHub_, _macOS_

Minimise punctuation within a heading and end it without punctuation. 

Number headings in an article only when there are many references in the text to the numbers. Where there are a few references to heading numbers, replace them with the italicised heading texts, linked to the headings. 


### Ordered and unordered lists

Use numbered lists only 

-   where it is necessary to refer to a list item, e.g. “as in (3) above”
-   where the order is significant, e.g. in a sequence of instructions 

Where 

-   a list has no more than five items; 
-   the items are short;
-   its items are clauses of a single sentence

suffix all but the last item with a semicolon, as in this sentence. 
Otherwise, leave the ends of list items unpunctuated. 


### Admonitions

Use admonitions for warnings, tips and notes.
