The Query Mapper is used to pair Data Source variables to Dashboard View State Parameters. 

Assign a query and execute as normal.  The output will list under _Key_ of Mapping property.

The Query Mapper is unique in it doesn't appear in the Dashboard User view - it's only viewable by the Dashboard designer.  

Not all Data Source need to be mapped to Dashboard View State Parameters.
