# Style


## Inline style

### Italics

Use italics for:

-   emphasis, e.g. “the _best_ way to do this is…”
-   reference to, rather than use of, a word, e.g. “the word _short_ is itself short“
-   the name of a q function or adverb denoted by a glyph, e.g. “the adverb _over_ is denoted by `/`”
-   for definitions, e.g. “An adverb combines with its function argument to return a new function: the  _derivative_.” 
-   citations of books or periodicals (but use double typographers’ quotes for the title of an article) e.g. “see “Functions and shadows” in _Vector_ 23:4” 


### Bold

Use bold styling

-   for _very strong_ emphasis, e.g. “Do not **ever** commit without running the tests.”
-   to mark words that aid a visual search, e.g.

    Where `x` is

    -   a **numeric atom**, returns the `x`<sup>th</sup> product of `y` and `z`
    -   a **symbol vector**, returns dictionary `y` with the keys of `x` switched with their values


### Inline code

Use inline code style for

-   executable expressions, including lambdas
-   the names of functions, including built-in q functions and operators, e.g. `over` and `+`
-   numeric values of explicit type, e.g. “the count of an empty list is 0, but the boolean for _false_ is `0b` – otherwise set numeric values as plain type
