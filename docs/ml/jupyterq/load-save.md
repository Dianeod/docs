# Loading and saving code


## Load

In addition to loading code with `\l` , code from a script _on the server_ can be loaded directly into a cell using a ‘magic’ command
```q
/%loadscript filename
```
This will not attempt to execute the code and any code in the rest of the cell will not execute.

## Save

```q
/%savescript filename [overwrite]
```
Will save contents of the cell as a script, optionally overwriting the script if it already exists
