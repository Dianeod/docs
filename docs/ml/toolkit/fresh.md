# <i class="fa fa-share-alt"></i> FRESH: a feature-extraction and feature-significance toolkit



<i class="fa fa-github"></i>
[KxSystems/ml](https://github.com/kxsystems/ml)

Feature extraction and selection are vital components of many machine-learning pipelines. Here we outline an implementation of the [FRESH](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.07717v3.pdf) (FeatuRe Extraction and Scalable Hypothesis testing) algorithm.

Feature extraction is the process of building derived, aggregate features from a time-series dataset. The features created are designed to characterize the underlying time-series in a way that is easier to interpret and provides a more suitable input to machine-learning algorithms.

Following feature extraction, statistical-significance tests between feature and target vectors can be applied. This allows selection of only those features with relevance (in the form of a p-value) above a given threshold.

Feature selection can improve the accuracy of a machine-learning algorithm by

-   Simplifying the models used.
-   Shortening the training time needed.
-   Avoiding the curse of dimensionality.
-   Reducing variance in the dataset to reduce overfitting.


Notebooks showing examples of the FRESH algorithm used in different applications can be found at

## Loading

Load the FRESH library using

```q
q)\l ml/ml.q
q).ml.loadfile`:fresh/init.q
```


## Data formatting

Data passed to the feature extraction procedure should contain an identifying (id) column, which groups the time-series into subsets from which features can be extracted. The id column can be inherent to the data or derived for a specific use-case (e.g. applying a sliding window onto the dataset).

Null values in the data should be replaced with derived values most appropriate to the column.

Data-types supported by the feature-extraction procedure are boolean, int, real, long, short and float. Other datatypes should not be passed to the extraction procedure.

In particular, data should not contain text (strings or symbols), other than the id column. If a text-based feature is thought to be important, one-hot encoding can be used to convert to numerical values.

!!! note
    A range of formatting functions (e.g. null-filling and one-hot encoding) are supplied in the [Utilities section](utils.md) of the toolkit.


## Calculated features

Feature-extraction functions are defined in the script `fresh.q` and found within the `.ml.fresh` namespace.

Feature-extraction functions are not, typically, called individually. A detailed explanation of each operation is therefore excluded.

!!! warning

    At present this feature-extraction procedure works only on functions which do not take hyper-parameters, accessed via `.ml.fresh.getsingleinputfeatures[]`.
    Functions with multiple parameters will be added in a future release.


## Feature extraction

Feature-extraction involves applying a set of aggregations to subsets of the initial input data, with the goal of obtaining information that is more informative than the raw time series. 

The `.ml.fresh.createfeatures` function applies a set of aggregation functions to derive features. There are 57 such functions available in the `.ml.fresh.feat` namespace, though users may select a subset based on requirements.

Syntax: `.ml.fresh.createfeatures[table;aggs;cnames;funcs]`

Where

-   `table` is the input data (table).
-   `aggs` is the id column name (symbol).
-   `cnames` are the column names (symbols) on which extracted features will be calculated (these columns should contain only numerical values).
-   `funcs` is the dictionary of functions to be applied to the table (a subset of `.ml.fresh.feat`).

This returns a table keyed by id column and containing the features extracted from the subset of the data identified by the id.

## Feature significance

Statistical-significance tests can be applied to the derived features, to determine how useful each feature is in predicting a target vector. The specific significance test applied, depends on the characteristics of the feature and target. The following table outlines the test applied in each case.

feature type       | target type       | significance test 
:------------------|:------------------|:------------------
Binary             | Real              | Kolmogorov-Smirnov
Binary             | Binary            | Fisher-Exact      
Real               | Real              | Kendall Tau-b     
Real               | Binary            | Kolmogorov-Smirnov

Each test returns a p-value, which can be passed to the Benjamini-Hochberg-Yekutieli (BHY) procedure. This determines if the feature meets a defined False Discovery Rate (FDR) level (set at 5% by default).

Both the calculation of p-values and the completion of the BHY procedure are contained within the `.ml.fresh.significantfeatures` function:

Syntax: `.ml.fresh.significantfeatures[table;targets]`

Where

-   `table` is the value section of the table produced by the feature-creation procedure
-   `targets` is a list of target values corresponding to the ids 

returns a list of the features deemed statistically significant.

Sample code:

```q
q)target:value exec avg col2+.001*col2 by date from tab / combination of col avgs
q)show sigfeats:.ml.fresh.significantfeatures[value features;target]
`absenergy_col2`countabovemean_col2`countbelowmean_col2`mean_col2`med_col2`mi..
q)count 2_cols tab      / number of raw features
2
q)count 1_cols features / number of extracted features
72
q)count sigfeats        / number of selected features
9
```

!!! note "Feature-significance tests may result in *no* significant features being found."


## Fine tuning

### Parameter dictionary

Hyperparameters for a number of the functions are contained in the dictionary `.ml.fresh.paramdict` (defined in the script `paramdict.q`). The default dictionary can be modified by users to suit their use cases better.


### User-defined functions

The aggregation functions contained in this library are a small subset of the functions that could be applied in a feature-extraction pipeline. Users can add their own functions by following the template outlined within `fresh.q`.
