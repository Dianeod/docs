# Appendix F - S3FS



S3FS is an open-source Linux client software layer that arbitrates between the AWS S3 storage layer and each AWS EC2 instance. It presents a POSIX file system layer to kdb+.

S3FS uses the Linux user-land FUSE layer. By default, it uses the POSIX handle mapped as an S3 object in a one-to-one map. It does not use the kernel cache buffer, nor does it use its own caching model by default.

Due to S3â€™s eventual consistency limitations file creation with S3FS can occasionally fail.

Metadata operations with this FS are slow. The append function, although supported is not usable in a production setting due to the massive latency involved.

With multiple kdb+ processes reading, the S3FS service effectively stalled.
