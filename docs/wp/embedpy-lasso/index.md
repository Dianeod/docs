# Machine learning: <br/>Using embedPy to apply LASSO regression



From its deep roots in financial technology Kx is expanding into new fields.
It is important for q to communicate seamlessly with other technologies. 
The [embedPy interface](/ml/embedpy) allows this to be done with Python.

The interface allows the kdb+ interpreter to manipulate
Python objects, call Python functions, and load Python libraries. 
Developers can fuse the technologies, allowing seamless application of q’s high-speed analytics and Python’s extensive libraries.

This whitepaper introduces embedPy, covering both a range of basic
tutorials as well as a comprehensive solution to a machine-learning
project. 

EmbedPy is available on GitHub for use with kdb+ V3.5+ and

-   Python 3.5+ on macOS or Linux 
-   Python 3.6+ on Windows

The installation directory also contains a `README.txt` about embedPy, and a
directory of detailed examples.
