Machine-learning capabilities are at the heart of future technology development at Kx.  Libraries are added here as they are released. 

[EmbedPy](embedPy/) loads Python into kdb+

-   Python variables and objects become q variables â€“ and either language can act upon them. 
-   Python code and files can be embedded within q code.
-   Python functions can be called as q functions.

All machine-learning libraries are:

-   well **documented**, with understandable and useful examples
-   maintained and **supported** by Kx on a best-efforts basis, at no cost to customers
-   released under the **Apache 2 license**
-   **free** for all use cases, including 64-bit and commercial use
