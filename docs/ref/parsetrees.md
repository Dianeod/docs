A _parse tree_ represents an expression, not immediately evaluated. Its virtue is that the expression can be evaluated whenever and in whatever context it is needed. The two main functions dealing with parse trees are `eval`, which evaluates a parse tree, and `parse`, which returns one from a string containing a valid q or k expression.

Parse trees may be the result of applying `parse`, or constructed explicitly. The simplest parse tree is a single constant expression. Note that, in a parse tree, a variable is represented by a symbol containing its name. To represent a symbol or a list of symbols, you will need to use [`enlist`](lists/#enlist) on that expression.
```q
q)eval 45
45
q)x:4
q)eval `x
4
q)eval enlist `x
`x
```
Any other parse tree takes a form of a list, of which the first item is a function and the remaining items are its arguments. Any of these items can be parse trees. Parse trees may be arbitrarily deep (up to thousands of layers), so any expression can be represented.
```q
q)eval (til;4)
0 1 2 3
q)eval (/;+)
+/
q)eval ((/;+);(til;(+;2;2)))
6
```


## parse 

Syntax: `parse x`

Where `x` is a string representing a well-formed q or k expression, returns a parse tree. (V3.4 can accept newlines within the string; previous versions cannot.)

The resulting parse tree can be executed with the `eval` function.
```q
q)parse "1 2 3 + 5"            / the list 1 2 3 is parsed as a single item
+
1 2 3
5
```
This function can clarify order of execution.
```q
q)parse "1 2 3 +/: 5 7"        / each-right has postfix syntax
(/:;+)
1 2 3
5 7
q)parse "1 2 3 +neg 5 7"       / neg is applied before +
+
1 2 3
(-:;5 7)
```
K expressions should be prefixed with `"k)"`, e.g.
```q
q)parseÂ "k)!10"
!:
10
```
Use `eval` to evaluate the parse tree:
```q
q)eval parse "1 2 3 +/: 5 7"
6 7 8
8 9 10
```
Explicit definitions in `.q` are shown in full:
```q
q)foo:{x+2}
q)parse "foo each til 5"
k){x'y}
`foo
(k){$[-6h=@x;!x;'`type]};5)
```
Q-SQL statements are parsed to the corresponding functional form.
```q
q)\l sp.q
q)x:parse "select part:p,qty by sup:s from sp where qty>200,p=`p1"
q)x
?
`sp
,((>;`qty;200);(=;`p;,`p1))
(,`sup)!,`s
`part`qty!`p`qty
q)eval x
sup| part qty
---| --------
s1 | p1   300
s2 | p1   300
```

!!! note "Parsing views"
    Views are special in that they are not parsable (sensibly) with `-5!x` (`parse`).
    <pre><code class="language-q">
    q)eval parse"a::5"
    5
    q)a
    5
    q)views[]
    `symbol$()
    </code></pre>


## eval

Syntax: `eval x`

Where `x` is a parse tree, returns the result of evaluating it. 

The `eval` function is the complement of `parse` and can be used to evaluate the parse trees it returns. (Also parse trees constructed explicitly.)
```q
q)parse "2+3"
+
2
3
q)eval parse "2+3"
5
q)eval (+;2;3)      / constructed explicitly
5
```


## reval

Syntax: `reval x`

The `reval` function is similar to `eval` (`-6!`), and behaves as if the [command-line option `-b`](cmdline/#-b-blocked) were active during evaluation.

An example usage is inside the message handler [`.z.pg`,](dotz/#zpg-get) useful for access control, here blocking sync messages from updating:
```q
q).z.pg:{reval(value;x)} / define in process listening on port 5000
q)h:hopen 5000 / from another process on same host
q)h"a:4"
'noupdate: `. `a
```

!!! tip "Partitioned databases"
    For partitioned databases, q caches the count for a table, and this count cannot be updated from within a `reval` expression or from a slave thread. Thus to avoid `'noupdate` on queries on partitioned tables you should put `count table` in your startup script.
