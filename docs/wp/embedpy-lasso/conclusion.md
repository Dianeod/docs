title: Machine learning – using embedPy to apply LASSO regression

# Conclusion




In this whitepaper, we have shown how easily embedPy allows q to
communicate with Python and its vast range of libraries and packages. We
saw how machine-learning libraries can be coupled with q’s high-speed
analytics to significantly enhance the application of solutions across
big data stored in kdb+. Python’s keywords can be easily communicated
across functions using the powerful `pykw`, and visualization tools such
as Matplotlib can create useful graphics of kdb+ datasets and analytics
results. Also demonstrated was how q’s vector-oriented nature is optimal
for cleaning and pre-processing big datasets.

This interface is useful across many institutions that are developing in
both languages, allowing for the best features of both technologies to
fuse into a powerful tool. Further machine-learning techniques powered
by kdb+ can be found under _Featured Resources_ at
