> I can’t understand why people are frightened of new ideas. I’m frightened of the old ones.

The Kx Systems technology consists of:

* kdb+ – the database
* q – an analytic and query language for kdb+
* k – the programming language underlying both kdb+ and q

This reference documents q – the main language for working with kdb+.

The kdb+ database and q language were introduced in 2003 as part of a 64-bit rewrite of the earlier kdb database. The underlying k language and databases have been developed since 1993.
