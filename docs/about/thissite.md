This site is the successor to the Mediawiki site – which for now can still be found at <http://code.kx.com/wiki>. The Reference section has been migrated from the wiki; the Cookbook is in progress.

## <i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Reference

The wiki’s Reference section, organised by glyphs, was a good tool for _reading_ q. It was easy to find, for example, all the possible meanings of `$`. On the other hand, a writer looking for tools to convert between datatypes and representations would have to explore most of the Reference section to be confident she had found them all. 

The new site reference has three aims:

- to be a _fast prompt_ for things already learned 
- to help _reading_ by showing what terms mean
- to help _writing_ by categorising the tools 


## <i class="fa fa-book"></i> Terminology

We have revised the terms in which we talk about q to align them with common usage. You will find _operators_ and _unary_ and _binary_ _functions_ applied _prefix_, _infix_ and _postfix_. Q’s _adverbs_ still need their distinctive name, but you will no longer find references to _verbs_, _monads_ or _dyads_. 

We also now distinguish consistently between glyphs and what they denote. In some cases we’ve had to coin new names for what was previously conflated. So, for example, `/` denotes three adverbs: _over_, _fold_ and _converge-repeat_. 

Overloads such as these are distinguished in use by syntax and arguments. Every operator, function and adverb now has its syntax and arguments consistently and clearly described.
