The Kx System consists of:

-   kdb+ - the database
-   q - an analytic and query language for kdb+
-   k - the programming language underlying both kdb+ and q

This reference documents q - the main language for working with kdb+.

History
-------

The kdb+ database and q language were introduced in 2003 as part of a 64-bit rewrite of the earlier kdb database. The underlying k language and databases have been developed since 1993.
